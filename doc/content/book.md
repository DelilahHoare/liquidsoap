The Liquidsoap book
===================

Together with the release of Liquidsoap 2.0, we have written a book called _the
Liquidsoap book_ which covers in details the language and the process of
building a radio. It complements the online documentation by providing a
homogeneous and progressive presentation of Liquidsoap.
